@summary: ElevationAndSlope is an open-source python and arcPy code.
          This script provides a characterization of linear UGO, DGO or AGO-scale databases with a set of topologic 
          metrics. From a DEM, five metrics are extracted : the upstream, downstream and mean elevations, the
          slope and the 3D slope. The slope is directly calculated as the ratio between the difference of elevation
          and the euclidean distance from up to downstream. The 3D slope is the ratio between the difference 
          of elevation and the river course length from up to downstream.
